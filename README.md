# Savings Rate Calculator


## What is the purpose of this project?

This application is meant to provide users with the ability to quantify their progress towards their financial goals. For many, the biggest financial unknown is there ability to retire. According to Fidelity, 

>  These guidelines can help you stay on course—or get up to speed. We recommend you save 15% of your income—including employer matching contributions—each year that you work until you turn 67.


Unfortunately, the reality is that:

> 40% of Americans would struggle to come up with $400 for an unexpected expense. 

This disparity is alarming because without the ability to cover a 400 dollar expense it is also likely that you aren't saving 15% of your income for retirement, leaving 40% of the population unable to retire.

My goal was to make an application that helped everyday people keep track of their savings rate so they can be better prepared for their futures.
